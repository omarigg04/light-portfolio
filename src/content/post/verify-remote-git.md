## Tutorial: How to Manage Remote Repositories with Git

In this tutorial, you will learn how to check the remote URL of your Git repository, as well as how to add and remove a remote repository.

## Check the Remote URL

To see which remote repository your Git project is pointing to, you can use the following command:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This command will show you something like the following:

```plaintext
origin  https://github.com/user/repository.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repository.git (push)
```

## Remove a Remote Repository

If you want to remove a remote repository (e.g., `origin`), you can use the following command:

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

This will remove the reference to the remote repository named `origin`.

## Add a New Remote Repository

To add a new remote repository, use the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin <URL-of-the-new-repository>
```

Replace `<URL-of-the-new-repository>` with the URL of the new repository you want to point to. For example:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/new-repository.git
```

## Complete Example

Here is a complete example of how to check, remove, and add a remote repository:

1. **Check the Remote URL**:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```plaintext
    origin  https://github.com/user/repository.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/user/repository.git (push)
    ```

2. **Remove the Current Remote Repository**:

    ```bash
    git remote remove origin
    ```

3. **Add a New Remote Repository**:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/user/new-repository.git
    ```

4. **Check the New Remote URL**:

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```plaintext
    origin  https://github.com/user/new-repository.git (fetch)
    origin  https://github.com/user/new-repository.git (push)
    ```

And that's it! Now you know how to manage your remote repository URLs in Git.
